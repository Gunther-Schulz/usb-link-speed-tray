# usb-link-speed-tray

Tray app showing link speed of attached external USB storage (e.g. 480 Mbps vs 5 Gbps).

## Git setup

If the folder is not yet a git repo (e.g. GitKraken won’t open it), run once:

```bash
cd ~/dev/Gunther-Schulz/usb-link-speed-tray
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Gunther-Schulz/usb-link-speed-tray.git
```

Then make an initial commit and push, or fetch from `origin` if the repo already has history.
